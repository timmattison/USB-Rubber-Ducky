 * Created by timmattison on 12/5/13.
 * <p/>
 * Built from http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_11.pdf
 * <p/>
 * The original USB Rubber Ducky application defines MENU and APP as code 101.  USB HID defines MENU as 118.
 * To maintain backwards compatibility USB HID's MENU was renamed MENU2
